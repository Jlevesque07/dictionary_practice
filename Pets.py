# 1. PETS: Make 3 dictionaries where each dictionary represents a different pet. 
# In each dictionary, include the kind of animal and the owner's name. 
# Store these dictionaries in a list called "pets". 
# Next, loop through your list and as you do, print everything you know about each pet. 
# Make sure the final output is nicely formatted and neat.
