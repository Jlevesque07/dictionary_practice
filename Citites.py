# 3. CITIES: Make a dictionary called "cities". 
# Use the names of three cities as keys in your dictionary. 
# Create a dictionary of information about each city and include the country that the city is in, its approximate population, and one fact about that city. 
# The keys for each city's dictionary should be something like "country, population, and fact". Print the name of each city and all of the information you have stored about it. 
# Make sure the final output is nicely formatted and neat
